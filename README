DAP-only jtag setup for omap5

Check the dss script and adjust to taste.

The target description (omap5-daponly.ccxml) assumes an XDS100v2 debugger
and will need to be adjusted when using a different one.

The included i2c.js *should* work but hasn't been properly tested since
it needs to enable irqs on the peripheral which is impossible without
getting into a fight with Linux.
